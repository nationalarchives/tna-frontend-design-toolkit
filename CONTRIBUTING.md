| **Useful**     | All new patterns and components must be a useful addition for users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Consistent** | All new patterns and components must be consistent with The National Archives brand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Value**      | All new patterns and components should add value to the toolkit and the user experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Evidence**   | All new patterns and components must be accompanied by evidence. If a pattern or component is replaces existing one, look to provide evidence to show it will improve on an existing approach.
